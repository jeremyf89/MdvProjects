  <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center;text-indent:.5in;"><span style="font-size:18.0pt; ">My family loves pizza, but my son&rsquo;s hunger for it is absurd. His name is Anthony, and it&rsquo;s obvious that he loves Meatos pizza the most. Every time we visit Meatos he goes all out, last time we visited he must have eaten 10 pieces. So he&rsquo;s going to be happy that Meatos pizza is our eating destination tonight! It&rsquo;s not cheap so, I&rsquo;ve decided that if he wants at least 12 pieces ill buy him a buffet. He has to finish his chores though, or he won&rsquo;t be eating a buffet tonight, rather ill just buy him a few slices, and to him that should be punishment enough.</span></p>

<p>I chose Obsession with Pizza simply, because my family does have a strong taste for it. My sons liking of pizza is crazy at time, and for the record Meatos pizza is fictional place. .</p>
